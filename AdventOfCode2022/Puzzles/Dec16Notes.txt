Let valve = the valve that we are currently at, let opened = the set of valves that have been opened. We'll consider valves with flow 0 to be opened already. Let m = number of minutes left
Let T(valve, opened, m) = the maximum flow we can obtain starting at the current valve, with opened valves and m minutes left
We want to solve T('AA', broken, 30)

The maximum number of valves that we can usefully open with m minutes left is Math.Floor(m / 2)

if m = 0 or 1, then there are no valves we can open, 

so T(_, _, 0) = T(_, _, 1) = 0

if m = 2, the only valve we could usefully open is the current one, so
T(current, _, 2) = current.Flow if current is open, 0 otherwise.

Otherwise, if current is opened, then 

T(current, opened, m) = max over v in closed T(v, opened, m - (dist(current, v))

if current is closed, then 

T(current, opened, m) = max over v in closed current.flow * (m - 1) + T(v, opened union {current}, m - dist(current, v) - 1)
